# Controlling-Exchange-Pathways
The repo is intended for the storing of scripts and data used in the paper "Controlling Exchange Pathways in Dynamic Supramolecular Polymers by Controlling Defects" **(current status: Under revision)**.

The paper is currently submitted to the preprint server ChemRxiv, at [paper](https://chemrxiv.org/s/db6eefa9556e78382f86).
The repository is organized as follows:

### /supervisedClustering/
folder containing scripts for carrying out the supervised analysis as discussed in the main paper.
Subfolders are divided in `kmeans` and `spectral` contain the different analysis as explained in the paper.

### /unbiasMD/
folder containing the Gromacs input files for reproducing the unbias MD trajectories of  the 3 types of fiber, as explained in the paper.

### /biasMD/
folder containing the PLUMED input files for reproducing enhanced sampling dynamics as discussed in the paper.

### updating ...
We apologies, folders and additional data will be added following the paper submission  procedures ..
