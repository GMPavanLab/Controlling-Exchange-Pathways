# Controlling-Exchange-Pathways
The repo is intended for the storing of scripts and data used in the paper "Controlling Exchange Pathways in Dynamic Supramolecular Polymers by Controlling Defects" **(current status: Published)**.

The paper is currently published in **ACS Nano**, at [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.1c01398).
The repository is organized as follows:

### /supervisedClustering/
folder containing scripts for carrying out the supervised analysis as discussed in the main paper.
Subfolders are divided in `kmeans` and `spectral` contain the different analysis as explained in the paper.

### /unbiasMD/
folder containing the Gromacs input files for reproducing the unbias MD trajectories of  the 3 types of fiber, as explained in the paper.

### /biasMD/
folder containing the PLUMED input files for reproducing enhanced sampling dynamics as discussed in the paper.

### Others
Others information are avaliable as Supporting Information (SI) of the main paper.
