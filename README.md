# Controlling-Exchange-Pathways
The repo is intended for the storing of scripts used in the paper "Controlling Exchange Pathways in Dynamic Supramolecular Polymers by Controlling Defects"

The paper is currently submitted to the preprint server ChemRxiv, at [paper](https://chemrxiv.org/s/db6eefa9556e78382f86).
The repository is organized as follows:

### /supervised
folder containing scripts for carrying out the supervised analysis as discussed in the paper.

### /unsupervised
folder containing inputs and scripts for carrying out the unsupervised analysis as discussed in the paper.
